    "        - $\\approx 10 \\cdot 10^{6}$ with highest concentration inside of the $5^{\\circ}$ angle of the fovea (most of them inside the $1^{\\circ}$ angle)\n",
    "- The eye does not gives a full resolution image on the complete field of view at once : to have a complete picture (litteraly), the brain has to merge image information taken by the most spatially resolved part of the eye, the fovea, while the eye is scanning the scene. Rods can be grouped in bundle to the optical nerve, meaning that the spatial localisation of the information is lower than the one given by cones having there own nervous termination.\n",

    "        - with 32 levels (right figure), false contours appear in large continuous regions (e.g. the sky).\n",
