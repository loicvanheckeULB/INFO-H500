    "Region growing is a simple region-based image segmentation method. It involves the selection of initial seed points. This approach analyses neighboring pixels of the initial seed points and determines whether or not the pixel neighbours should be added to the region. The process is iterated on, in the same manner as general data clustering algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seed point selection is based on user criterion : pixels that are in a certain grayscale range, pixels that are evenly spaced on a grid, ... The initial region begins as the exact location of these seeds. The regions are then grown from these seed points to adjacent points depending on a region membership criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the regions are grown on the basis of the criterion, the image information itself is important. For example, if the criterion is a pixel intensity threshold value, the histogram of the image could be useful to determine a suitable threshold value for the region membership criterion. The 4-neighbours strucuring element could be used to grow from the seed points. An alternative for pixels adjacent relationship is the 8-neighbours strucuring element. Pixels adjacent to the seed points are then examined and classified into the seed points if they have the same intensity value."

Watersheds may also be defined in the continuous domain. There are also many different algorithms to compute watersheds."
